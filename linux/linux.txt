if we want to work with linux server ,ssh tools and ftp tools are the prereq one.
for sending the file r downloading the file from server tat time we can use the ftp tools.
The ftp tools are  1.winscp and 2.filezilla
For connecting the server we need details like , 1.ipaddress/hostname 2.username and password

In windows we used to call main drive as c Driver, LIKE CDRIVE IN LINUX IT CALLED AS ROOT DIRECTORY (\) IT WILL HAVE MANY FILES INSIDE THAT ROOT DR

A--Rootdirectory or parent directory,it willl have many sub directories.
home directory---> is like c drive in user,it have users information.
for eg we have 4 user means for every user it will create a separate dir with their names
QN-- how can we find how many users are their ,,by gng to home and ls the dir

UNDER ROOT DIR WILL HAVE SOME SUB DIR (below are the sub dir of root dir)
1.BIN 
it contain all binary file ,for all and every each cmnd,will have bin file (eg ls,cmnd ... so that every commands will have the sep bin files)

2.S BIN-- SYSTEM BINARIES

(it also contains some binary files ),like useradd, userdel,shutdown etc.. 
 
DIFF TYPES OF USERA IN LINUX:
1.ROOT USER /super user /admn user --> While installling the linux tat timesitself rootuser will create
                Root user can create a n num of users,bt it have only one root user. all the preveilage have the root user

2.NORMAL USER --> have n number of user created by the root user(all the details of user in home dir)

3.SYSTEM USER --> while installing a softwares like jenkins , docker tat time it will have a sysytem user
                  while installing jenkins  that time the software is going to create a user called a jenkins ( all the details of system user
                  will be in the {shadow and the passwd files.}
QN DIFF BW BIN AND SBIN.
what ever the binaries which are available in the bin and sbin can be accessed by the ->root user ,,,, normal user and the system user can access only the bin files.

3.ETC Dir --> It contains all the config files (like sudoers ,sshdconfig,profile,shadow,group,password,motd(msg of the day)while logging it will have a welcome msg.
           [shadows and passwd files have the all the info abt the normal user,root user,and system user.

4.Lib Dir (Library) --->all the libraries file will stored here (os lib also will stored here only)

5.proc DIR(process) --->1. if we executing the commands in shell scrpit ,r if we executing any commands will have process id , those
                     process id infor are avail and stored here only.
                     2.Along with this we have 2 more files CPU INFO and MEMINFO...cpu info (will have cpu information)
                     Mem info(will have memory information)

6.opt Dir--> by defaulty it will be empty, in this dir we are gng to install the softwares,
             in win if we install some sw means it will go dir to the PROGRAM FILES s,imlinux it will be as opt
             All the 3rd parties sw are gng to install in the optDIR ,by defaulty as a normal user dont have to access to this opt dir.we need to be a super user

7.Temp Dir-->(it is the temporary directory, can be accesd by all the user) for eg there are 2 usrs rock and mock,rock home dir is home/ROCK
             mockhome dir is -->home/mock , rock want to send his filename called devops.txt how he will send (user cannt have permission
             to reach another persion) so copy the file in temp ,temp can be accesd by all user so mock will copy via the temp file
             and he will paste in this .
8.var dir-->(our system logs will be in this dir)
9.DEV Dir (devices)--> it contains info abt the device eg one external device (printer r harddisk) is connected to the server means it will ahave that devices info.
--------------------------------------------------------------------******--------------------------------------------------------
                                                            LINUX COMMENTS
mkdir test --> it will create a new dir called test
mkdir -v devops--> it will display that the directory is created (-v = purpose)
mkdir -p devops/linux/shell/tomcat/sonarcube -->it will create all the directories in a single cmd,1st it will check for the parent dir 
mkdir -vp devops/linux/shell/tomcar/sonarcube -->it will create all dir and it will display tat we r created a dir
mkdir -m 700 python--> it will create a python dir with some custom permission ,r else it will be in default permission
uname - it will show wt os we are using
pwd --> it show present working dir
ls -->it will list the file r dir ,, ls devops/---> it will list what is inside the devops dir
touch devops.txt-->it will create a file with a name of devops.
ls -l(long list)--> it will display the full details abt the particular filename r dir 
                    if it is a dir means it will be -d for (dir)
                    if it is a file means it is gng to start with - for (file)
{drwxrwxr-x 3    ec2-user  ec2-user 19       Dec 11 11:51 devops
permision  link  usrname  grpname  filesize   time
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  0       Dec 11 11:51 devops.txt}
-------- --> which means no permission
-x ---->executable one
ls -la (a=all)---> it displays all the hiddenfiles along with the dir and files.
sudo su -      ---->is used to switch as a root user.
exit r sudo su ec2-user--> it back to the normal user.
{ls -l -->it will show our data memory in numb
ls -lh (h= human readable)-->it will disply the data in kb r mb}
ls -lt(last time) ---> it will list the dir and file name in according to the time we created the file nd dir (it will be in ascending order)
ls -ltr(r = reverse) ---> it will display according to the priority what we created first along with the time 

what is Inode---> it is data structure ,it can store the file/dir info ,,,, the info contains 1.permission, 2.grp name ,3.links, 4.ownername, 5.timestamp,6.size
ls -li   ---> Inode it contains the number as we cant able to remem tat so we can call using file name r the dir name.
             os can access using tat inode to access the file r dir ,we dont use tat inode
cd (change dir)--> i am in a home user wanto go devops dir means using this cd devops i can access this.
cd devops/Ltab/stab --> directly it will go the sonarcube dir
cd .. --> onelevel up (the dir comes backward 1 step from sonarcube to tomcat)
cd ../.. two level up --> cd ../../.. -->three level up
cd ~ or cd --> it will take to user home dir
cd - ---> it will take to the previous dir from the home user dir

rmdir ---> it will delete only the empty dir
rm -rf devops ---> (remove forcefully) ---> it will delete all the sub dir 1st
rm -f devops.txt---> is used to delete the files.


touch devops.txt--> is used to create a empty files
vi devops.txt ---> to update r to write some data to a file 
cat devops.txt-->  is used to view the content of the file
touch devops.txt--> 1st it will check for the existing file ,if it is existed it will update only the timestamp,
                    or it will create a new txt file.

diff bw sudo su - and sudo su ---> sudo su - --> it will switch from normal user to the switch user and IT WILL POINT TO THE ROOT HOMEDIR
                                                 AND IT WILL LOAD ROOT USER CONFIGURATION.
                                  SUDO SU ---> IT WILL SWITCH TO THE ROOT USER AND POINT OUT THE CURRENT DIR.
------------------------------------------------*****---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO FIND THE FILE:
find . -type f ----> in present wrkng dir in will find the how many files are there.
find . -type f -empty ---> it tells r (gng to search) in present wrkng dir how many epmty files are there.
find ~ -type f -empty ---> it tells in home dir it will say how many empty files are there. 
find / -type f -empty  ---> it will search in root dir that how many epmty file r there.

HOW TO FIND THE DIR :
find . -type d -empty--> in pws it will find how many empty dir are available.

While creating a file r dir it will have default permission ,the defaut permission is setting depends on  UMASK values r (user mask)
THE USER MASK VALUE IS DIFFERS BY ROOT USER AND THE NORMAL USER,
DEFAULT ROOT USER VALUE - 0022
DEFAULT NORMAL USER VALUE -0002     both are default values setting by the os.
Umask- it will display the values
we can able to change the umask values by -->umask 0222 it will overwrite the permission.

A.IN root user ,if we create a dir  or files means it will minus the base permission value and the default root value
   1.Base permission for dir --->      0777
   default permission for root user--> 0022                                                              0755
                                       -----
                                       0755 ---> this is the default dir perssion in root user.
  2.Base permission for file --->    0666
    default permission for root-->   0022                                                                0644
                                    ---------
                                     0644  --> this is default file per in root user

B.IN nor user ,if we create a dir means it will minus the base permission value and the default root value
  1. Base permission for dir --->        0777
   default permission for root user-->   0002                                                           0775  
                                         -----
                                         0775 ---> this is the default dir perssion in normal user.
  2.Base permission for file --->    0666
    default permission for root-->   0002
                                    ---------                                                           0664
                                     0664  --> this is default file per in root user

read = 4
write = 2   -->  775--> 7- user 7-group 5-others    --->700
exe = 1     ---> rwx rwx r-x                            rwx --- ---

we can change the umask value,after we relogin again it will set a deffault umask value ,,bt if we wANT change permanently means
/home/gokul/
~.bash_profile                       ----------> this is applicable only for the gokul user 
here we can add umask 0222

/etc/profile/
here add (umask 0222)              --->this is  applicable for all the user.

------------------prac
ls -l (our all file will be there)
now if we do--> umask 222--> changing the umask value
now--> umask (it will show the umask value as 222)
now if we create the new file means it will have only the newly created umask value,bt it wont distrub previous one files nd dir
 umask --> based on the permission only umask is going to set.

--------------------------
top -- our current session wont be inactive. by pressing ctrl c it will stop and we an can continue our work.
chmod --->using this cmnd we can able to change file permission.
       syntax---> chmod permissions dirname/filename

chmod 777 Devops --> it will chnage only for the parent dir not for sub dir.
Chmod -R 777 Devops --> it will change the perm for all sub dir.
touch Devops/linux/test.txt--> after assinging per it will create a dir
GIVING PERMISSION VIA ALPHABETICAL 
chmod ugo +r test.txt
chmod ugo +w test.txt
chmod ugo +x test.txt
chmod ugo -rwx test.txt ---> is used to remove all the permission.
741 -all acces user for all ,read access for group,excute access for others.
 chmod u+rwx,g+r,o+x.
-wx-wx-wx --> can we enter the text in this file, the ans is no bcz we dont have read acces, without that we cant able to do nthg.
chown root file r dirname (is used t0 change the owner r user name, bt we should be in roo
chgrp wheel test.txt(file r dir name)-->is used to change the grp name,bt the user should be in our grp.(wheel is the predefined grp in linux)
chown ec2-user:ec2-user test.txt (is used to creata a owner name nd the grp name together)
--------------------------------------------------xxxxxxx--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cp(copy)  --->cpying the file or dir from the one file dir to othrt file r dir.
cp fn/dirn dirname
cp test.txt devops 
cp -r python devops (cpyng one dir to other dir )

mv (is the move cmnd is used to move a file r dir or we can rename)
cp *.txt (dir r file name)--> is used to copy all the text file to another dir r file.
cp *.txt 

file -->cmd is used to find which type of file is this.should done in home dir
  file (dirname/txt files)
eg file gv/python __> it shows wt types of file is python.

wc filename ---> is tells how many lines,words,and bytes r char in the file.
wc -l filename --> it tells about how many line are there in the file
wc -w filenname --> it tells about how many words are there in the file
wc -c filename --> it tells about how many bytes r data are there in the file.

ln--> it will create a link between a file 
    opt/flipkart/flipkart.log ----->normal user want to see the logfile of flipkart nuser dont have permission
                                    to acces so cpy this in to tmp file.
  cp opt/flipkart/flipkart.log /tmp/ ---> here we cant able to see the updated log file so create a link to see the regular log.
  ln /opt/flipkart/flipkart.log /tmp/lntest.txt ----> here we can see all the current regular updated logs here.(is called hardlink
                                                                                                             have same features & properties)
In hardlink what are the files we have in main files will have the copy of ln file,so the harddisk will get affect.
if we have a n number of hardlink our harddisk capacity will be more so gng to SOFTLINK.
if we delete the original file we can able to access the haardlinked file
INODE:
-----
inode also same as the hard link

SOFTLINK:---->i it will create a shortcut of the linked files so the mem size will be low.
ln -s test.txt lnsoft.txt---> for creating the soft lin

DIFF BW HARD AND SOFT LINK:
HARDLINK                                                                                              SOFTLINK
*What are the files we have in mainfiles it will have  | they dont have the same properties of the main files bt they have  
the same properies in linkfiles                        |            create a shortcut files
**memory size is high                                  | memsize is very low
$IF we delete a mainfile we can able to access the     |$ if we delete a mainfile we cant able to access the main files.
linked files                                           |


TEXT EDITOR COMMAND:
 VI and the VIM are diff editor ,coomparing to vi ,vim have a spl feature.

vi python.txt---> if it is not available it is gng to open a file in command mode ,in cmnd mode we can't able to edit so press I
:wq! -----> write(save) and quit
:q!-----> without save quit
:q---> already in the cmnd mode so no need to press esc

vim and nano wont we available so ssudo yum install vim nano -y
 if we want to list the line number --->:set nu -->set number
                                        :set nonu-->disabling the line numbers
/python ----->in vim text it will highlight with the word python
:11  ---> it will highlight the line number 11

NANO EDITOR:
 ctrl+o ---->save
 ctrl+x ---->exit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              TEXT READING/DISPLAY COMMANDS
echo ----> is used to print the output.
cat --> to see the content of the file.
cat -n file name (is used to view file with the line number)
head filename -->(is used to view the first 10 line of the file)
head -n 25 filename -->(is used to view the 1st 25 line of the file)
tail filename --->(is used to view the last 10 line of the file)
tail -n 25 filename--->(is used to view the last 25 line of the file)
sed '30 p' filename -->(is used to print the particular line of the file)
sed '30,50 p filename--> (it will print the range of line no from 30 to 50)
sed 's/red/blue/' filename(is used to change only the first occurance)
sed 's/red/blue/2'filename(is used to change only the second occurance)
sed 's/red/blue/g'filename(is used to change all globally)
s=stream=output(it will not save in the original file)
sed -i 's/red/blue/g' filename

more filename -->(is used to view the file page by page)
 cntrl+f --> to move page forward
 cntrl+b --> to move page backward

sort filename ---> is used to arrange tha alphabetical order
| --> is called as pipe (is used to save the temporary output and that out will give a input to the other command)
cat filename | sort ---> (sort cmnd without giving seperately using pipe we can give in the same cmnd)used to display the 
cat filename | sort -r --->(it display to sort in a reversing order)

tr --> translate (a-z) (A-Z) (is used to convert upper case to lower case)
cat filename | sort | tr [a-z] [A-Z]

GREP-->Global regular expression print (is used for searching purpose)
eg (in a file name called sorting in that we need to search for zebra means using this cmnd we can able to search)
grep jungle sorting.txt 
grep JUNGLE sorting.txt
grep -i jungle sorting.txt --> ignoring case sensitive
grep 'jungle king' sorting.txt --> to search a multiple words word.
------------------------------system resource commands----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
who ---> it shows who is logged in,which user is logged in
who -H--> it will display the logged in usr with heading.
w --> it show how many user logged in and it shows uptime,and it say what they are doing,and also give status abt
      load avg(how our cpu is gng to performing)
      QN? --. what are the intervals of load avg:
              1st min , 5th min, 15th min
               0.00      0.00     0.00
if it above 8.8 means cpu is highly utilized

uptime ---> it tells abt the uptime of the server
unmae ---> is used to display the os.
uname -r ---> is used to display the kernerl release
cat /etc/os-release --> is use to view the os release
cat /proc/cpuinfo--> is used to view the cpu info
QN?---> How to check the core of the cpu -->cat /proc/cpuinfo
QN? DIFF bw who and w command --> both are same bt comparing to who w as more cmnds w has loadaverage values


for each cmnd they will have a manual page (it describe abt the cmnd)
and also they used to have the binary files.
whereis ls--> it display the ls bin and manual location
whereis pwd--> it display the pwd bin and manual location

top---> it will show which process takes how much utilization
date-->print date and time
