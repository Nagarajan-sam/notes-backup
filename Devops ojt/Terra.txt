terraform = is a tool for infra provisioning
it automate and manage our infrastructure,our platform,and the service tat runs on the platform  open source and declarative.
declarative= we should not want to explain the every steps,and also it define what end result we want.

for eg:
  we need to deply the  app means ,we need to 1st create a infra need to provison the the needed servers inthat server we deploying our container to the server using container etc etc
To prepare infra we need
 pvt network nw space 
 ec2 server inst
 install docekr and the tools
 security neede to tat
AFTER CREATING THE INFRA WE NEED TO DEPLOY THE APP.(THIS IS THE TOTAL WORK) 

We can replicate the same infra in diff env.
eg dev to prod.

HOW TERRAFORRM CONNECT TO THE AWS PLATFORM PROVIDER?
  it contains 2 componentw:
    1.TF CORE
        It contains 2 input src
            1.TF CONFIG in order to do the job ,where user can create and config the needs
            2.TF STATE  IT have the current state of the setup of TF
      TFCORE get the input from both TFCONFIG AND STATE and it will plan and do the need whats to be created r updated r destoyed 
    2.PROVIDES = AWS ,AZURE,GCP (IAAS)
                 K8 (PAAS)
                 Fastly(saas)
